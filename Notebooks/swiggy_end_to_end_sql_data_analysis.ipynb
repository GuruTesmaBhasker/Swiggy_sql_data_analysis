    "## Project Overview: Swiggy End-to-End SQL Data Analysis System\n",
    "\n",
    "This project simulates a real-world **Swiggy-like food delivery platform** with the goal of performing **end-to-end SQL data analysis** on user orders, restaurant performance, and delivery efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus of this project is **data generation, database design, and analysis**, not building a full production app.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Frontend Simulation (Data Source)\n",
    "\n",
    "A Swiggy-style frontend UI was generated using AI to simulate realistic user behavior such as:\n",
    "- Browsing restaurants\n",
    "- Selecting food items\n",
    "- Adding items to cart\n",
    "- Placing an order\n",
    "\n",
    "The frontend is used **only as a data generator**, mimicking how users interact with a food delivery platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "No authentication, payment, or personal user details were implemented, as they are not required for data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Database Design (Schema Creation)\n",
    "\n",
    "A dedicated MySQL database (`swiggy_da`) was created with a **normalized relational schema** to store transactional data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following tables were designed with proper **primary keys and foreign key constraints**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `users` – stores user location data  \n",
    "- `restaurants` – restaurant metadata  \n",
    "- `menu_items` – food items linked to restaurants  \n",
    "- `orders` – order-level details  \n",
    "- `order_items` – items within each order  \n",
    "- `deliveries` – delivery time and ETA data  \n",
    "- `reviews` – post-delivery ratings  \n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign keys were intentionally enforced to maintain **data integrity**, similar to real production systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Backend Integration (Flask API)\n",
    "\n",
    "A lightweight backend was built using **Flask** to act as an API layer between the frontend and the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key responsibilities of the backend:\n",
    "- Receive order data via POST requests\n",
    "- Insert orders and order items into MySQL\n",
    "- Simulate delivery time (expected vs actual)\n",
    "- Enforce database constraints during insertion\n",
    "\n",
    "This step ensures that all data entering the database follows a **realistic ingestion pipeline**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initial Data Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Before placing orders, required parent records were inserted manually:\n",
    "- A sample user was added to the `users` table\n",
    "- A restaurant was added to the `restaurants` table\n",
    "- Menu items were added to the `menu_items` table\n",
    "\n",
    "This was necessary because foreign key constraints require parent records to exist before inserting child records.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Order Simulation (End-to-End Flow)\n",
    "\n",
    "A POST request was sent to the Flask API simulating a real user placing an order:\n",
    "- User selects a restaurant\n",
    "- Chooses food items\n",
    "- Confirms the order\n",
    "\n",
    "The backend successfully:\n",
    "- Created a new record in `orders`\n",
    "- Inserted corresponding rows in `order_items`\n",
    "- Generated delivery metrics in `deliveries`\n",
    "\n",
    "The API returned a success response, confirming the order was stored correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Verification & Data Integrity Check\n",
    "\n",
    "After the API call, SQL queries were executed to verify:\n",
    "- Orders were correctly stored\n",
    "- Items were linked to the order\n",
    "- Delivery information was recorded\n",
    "- All foreign key relationships were preserved\n",
    "\n",
    "This confirms that the **entire pipeline works end-to-end**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup closely mirrors how data flows in real food delivery platforms and forms a strong foundation for SQL-based data analysis and business insights.\n",
